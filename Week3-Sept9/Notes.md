Pick some aspects of the Kotlin programming language, and discuss what you like and what you dislike (or maybe are not a fan of right now, or maybe just don't fully understand so you consider it unusual or difficult).  Discuss these aspects of Kotlin, and compare and contrast with Java or another high-level programming language with which you are familiar (e.g., C++, C#, Python, Swift).

Make sure to respond to at least one of your peers' posts as well.
